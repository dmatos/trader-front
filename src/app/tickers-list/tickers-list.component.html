<p> I want a text field as a filter and list of items below it </p>
<p> I want a service that return tickers based on a filter that can look for tickers and exchanges at the same time</p>
<p> I want to list filtered tickers or all of them if there is no filter </p>
<p> I want to select tickers from the list so I can display their candlestick on the plotter </p>
<p style="color: red">I want a date picker so I can select the date range for the candlestick to be plotted</p>
