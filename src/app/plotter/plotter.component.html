<p> I am a plotter app that accepts candlestick and lines</p>
<p>Now I want to use some nice plotter library like google one</p>
<p>I want a service that returns a plotter for candlestick or linear data</p>
<p>I want a service that fetches the candlesticks from the back-end</p>
<p>A service that returns the moving averages</p>
<p>I want a service that plot the candlesticks and return this plot so I can display it</p>
<p>I have to learn how to cover it with unit tests</p>
